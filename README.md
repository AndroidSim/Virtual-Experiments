# Virtual Experiments
## Experiment Control
This directory contains various scripts to control an experiment, such as linking databases, creating configuration and parameter files, and running the experiment, including on a cloud distribution.  
## Analysis and Plotting
This directory contains various scripts to analyze data resulting from an experiment, and the directory, Plotting, contains various scripts to plot raw or derived data. 
## Utilities
This directory contains various scripts, mainly mathematical procedures, that are involved in analyses.

I either entirely wrote or contributed to all script files in the above directories. This is still a work in progress.
